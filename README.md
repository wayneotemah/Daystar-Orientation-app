<h1 align="center">Personal school project I created to aid in Daystar Orientation May 2022.</h1>

Case problem: During oreination to my cumpus, DAYSTAR UNI KENYA, their is usually so much information to be communicated to the new parents and students.

Solution: I sort to create an internet based application that servers as a centralised source of communication for both the new students and parents and also the orientation team.
